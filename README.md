# Language Translation Model: README
## Overview
This project implements a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) language translation model using LSTM-based neural networks. The model translates sentences from a source language (e.g., English) to a target language (e.g., French). The implementation leverages TensorFlow's Keras API for building and training the model.

## Features
* **Sequence-to-Sequence Architecture**: Uses an encoder-decoder framework with LSTM layers for translation tasks.
* **Customizable Vocabulary**: Tokenizes and preprocesses both source and target languages dynamically based on the input data.
* **Start and End Tokens**: Handles sequence boundaries using "start" and "end" tokens for better training and inference.
* **Dynamic Translation**: Supports translation of arbitrary input sentences post-training.
* **Model Training and Validation**: Provides options for validation and performance tracking during training.

  
## Prerequisites
### Libraries
* Python (3.7 or above)
* TensorFlow (2.x or above)
* NumPy

## Dataset
The model requires parallel datasets of source and target language sentences. Each source sentence should align with its corresponding target sentence.

Example Dataset:
### Source Texts (English):

* Copy code
* hello how are you
* what is your name
* where are you from
* i am doing well
* nice to meet you

### Target Texts (French):

* Copy code
* bonjour comment allez-vous
* quel est votre nom
* d'o√π venez-vous
* je vais bien
* ravi de vous rencontrer



## Model Details
### Architecture
#### Encoder:

* **Embedding layer**: Converts input sequences into dense vector representations.
* **LSTM layer** : Processes the sequence and outputs a hidden state and cell state.
  
#### Decoder:

* **Embedding layer**: Converts target sequences into dense vectors.
* **LSTM layer**: Generates predictions based on the input and encoder states.
* **Dense layer**: Outputs probabilities for each word in the target vocabulary.
#### Hyperparameters

* Latent Dimension: 256
* Max Sequence Length: 20
* Batch Size: 32
* Epochs: 500

### Limitations
* **Dataset Size**: Performance is limited by the quality and size of the dataset.
* **Generalization**: May not generalize well to unseen data without additional training.
* **Translation Quality**: Simple architecture; results may not match state-of-the-art translation models.
### Future Enhancements
* Implement attention mechanisms for improved translation accuracy.
*Add beam search for better predictions during inference.
*Support for multi-language translation.
*Expand training datasets for more diverse sentence structures.
